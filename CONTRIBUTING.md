## Code Style

Code in the Orca repo is expected to follow a certain set of style guidelines. Each directory contains a `.editorconfig` file to be integrated with developer IDEs, and generally serves as a list of details for how code should be formatted.

## Commit Messages and Pull Requests

Commit messages should follow the guidelines developed by the developers who originally worked on angular. These rules can be found here.

Pull requests submitted to Orca are expected to be small, covering only a single feature (fix, refactor, etc.) to be added to the repository. Issues that apply to the changes should be linked. If a pull request is in progress, it should be marked as a draft.

Titles should be a brief description of what the changes aim to do, and the larger explanation of the pull request should take the following format:

1. **Description**: A longer explanation of what issues are being addressed and/or what feature is being added.
2. **Solution**: An overview of what was changed. Often, a bullet-point list of high-level changes will suffice.
