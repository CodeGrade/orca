## Code Style

Code in the Orca repo is expected to follow a certain set of style guidelines. Each directory contains a `.editorconfig` file to be integrated with developer IDEs, and generally serves as a list of details for how code should be formatted.

## Commit Messages and Pull Requests

Commit messages should follow the [Semantic Commit Messages gist](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).

Pull requests submitted to Orca are expected to be small, covering only a single feature (fix, refactor, etc.) to be added to the repository. Issues that apply to the changes should be linked. If a pull request is in progress, it should be marked as a draft.

Titles should be a brief description of what the changes aim to do, and the larger explanation of the pull request should take the following format:

1. **Description**: A longer explanation of what issues are being addressed and/or what feature is being added.
2. **Solution**: An overview of what was changed. Often, a bullet-point list of high-level changes will suffice.
