# Orca: A Grading Server

Orca is a grading server that works in tandem with [Bottlenose](https://github.com/codegrade/bottlenose).

The server's main functionality is provided with a REST API, where the files from a student submission are submitted (_possibly_) with
teacher files and a configuration for how to build and test the submission.
