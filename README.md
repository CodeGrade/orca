## Stack

Orca expects the following tools with these versions:

- Redis 7.x (Grading Queue)
- Node 16.15.x (Web Server and Client)
- Python 3.8.x (Grading VM)

## Local Development

All local development is expected to be done in an environment running on **Ubuntu 20.04**.

This can either be done with a machine directly running the OS or with a Windows machine running WSL2.

For instructions about how to set up Ubuntu through WSL2 and Windows Terminal, [visit this page](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview). For a more "aesthetic" and informative bash experience, developers can also set up [Starship](https://starship.rs/). Make sure to also add VSCode integration with the WSL2 terminal.

### VSCode Extensions

The following VSCode extensions are expected to be installed for the best development experience:

- **WSL** - allows direct access to code with Ubuntu (bash) terminal.
- **Prettier** - used for enforcing code style and formatting files.
- **ESLinter** - used for enforcing TypeScript code guidelines and error detection.
- **Python** - used for IDE linting of Python code.
