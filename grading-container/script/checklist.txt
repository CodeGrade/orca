Workflow and Implementation Details:

- Import GradingJob from JSON [X]
  - Read in JSON from sys.stdin [X]
  - Validate the JSON schema [X]
  - Convert into Class/object [X]
  - Cover Fail Case/Convert error to GradingJobOutput object [ ]

- Download Files [ ]
  - Generate secret for build and other dirs so students cannot guess path names [ ]
  - Use HTTP request (basically curl/wget) with given URLs [ ]
  - Extract into directories [ ]
    - Security measures (see ArchiveUtils on Bottlenose) [ ]
    - Change Behavior based on single code file vs .zip file [ ]
      - Extract file extension [ ]

- Execute GradingScript [ ]
  - Interpolated Strings [ ]
    - Define where student/starter/professor code is [ ]
    - Define where build directory will be [ ]
  - Allow for retries/navigation between indices [ ]
  - Implement logic for "abort" and "output" [ ]
  - Stop execution on Errors [ ]
  - Logging of execution details (Audit) [ ]
  - Send to Output Object [ ]
  - Lock down Program [ ]
    - Network Access (likely a Docker thing) [ ]
    - File/IO access (how?) [ ]

- Output and Results [ ]
  - Write results as JSON to sys.stdout [ ]
